# The first project of 42Lisboa ðŸ¤–

After weeks and weeks of not looking at a computer I presented myself, on October 18th 2021, with libft.

"Two weeks and I'm done with this" - said a very naive jviknander

With the help of my peers (some may I even call *friends* ðŸ’–), the project was delivered after a month of relearning *almost* everything from piscine.
