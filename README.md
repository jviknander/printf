## recode the printf function 👩‍💻

Once you understand [variadic functions](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/variadic-functions-in-c/) / [variable argument lists](https://www.cprogramming.com/tutorial/c/lesson17.html) this project can be easily done in 2-3 days *(without the bonus part, of course)*

Maybe someday I'll have the guts to get back at ft_printf and do it with flags `# +` , but for now I will deliver the project with just the mandatory part 😗
